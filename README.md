# Flail - a command-line MUA in Perl #

Flail is an MUA in Perl.  If
[Mail::Box](http://perl.overmeer.net/mailbox/),
[App::Cmd](http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/App-Cmd-0.327/lib/App/Cmd.pm)
and
[Devel::REPL](http://search.cpan.org/~ether/Devel-REPL-1.003026/lib/Devel/REPL.pm)
went to London and did one of those experimental three-parent baby
deals, flail would be the result.
