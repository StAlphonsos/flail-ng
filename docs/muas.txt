# MUAs in OpenBSD ports under mail/ -*- indent-tabs-mode:nil; tab-width:8 -*-

2017-05-03

My ongoing effort to collect metadata about F/OSS MUAs, starting with
those in the OpenBSD ports tree.

First cut at basic infos about how well MUAs are tested and if they
use any app-level security patterns like privsep.

# name		# type          # loc  # tloc # tests # vuls # privsep
alpine  	# textmode      #  90k # 0    # 0     # ?    # no

Columns:
  loc: lines of application code
  tloc: lines of test code
  tests: number of tests (however the project defines that)
  vuls: public vuls reported
  privsep: uses privsep/sandboxing/any app security features

N.B. All "lines of code" measurements from cloc (textproc/cloc).  Some
twiddling required to not double-count tests, etc.

Notes:

[1]elm has #ifdef _TEST at the bottom of some files, not sure if
   there's an easy way to run them, some (all?) of them are
   interactive, not automatic.

[2]the name of the port is really mail/mozilla-thunderbird

[3]mu4e, the MUA that comes with mu, does talk to a separate mu
   server process where mail is parsed.  it is not sandboxed.
