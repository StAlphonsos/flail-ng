# MUAs in OpenBSD ports under mail/ -*- indent-tabs-mode:nil; tab-width:8 -*-

2017-05-03

My ongoing effort to collect metadata about F/OSS MUAs, starting with
those in the OpenBSD ports tree.

First cut at basic infos about how well MUAs are tested and if they
use any app-level security patterns like privsep.  Some kind of date
info is really needed (last update? first release? latest vul?).

Columns:
  loc: lines of application code
  tloc: lines of test code
  tests: number of tests (however the project defines that)
  vuls: public vuls reported
  privsep: uses privsep/sandboxing/any app security features

N.B. All "lines of code" measurements from cloc (textproc/cloc).  Some
twiddling required to not double-count tests, etc.

Notes:

[1]elm has #ifdef _TEST at the bottom of some files, not sure if
   there's an easy way to run them, some (all?) of them are
   interactive, not automatic.

[2]there may be some over-arching gnome test suite thing that I
   have not found yet, still investgiating this.

[3]the name of the port is really mail/mozilla-thunderbird. the line
   counts are not fair b/c they include the browser.  for comparison
   several other MUAs link against some version of WebKit, which is
   immense and does not count on their linecount.  I have still not
   gotten the tbird tests to run under OpenBSD, not sure to say how
   many there are.

[4]mu4e, the MUA that comes with mu, does talk to a separate mu server
   process where mail is parsed.  it is not sandboxed nor does it run
   with reduced privs - performance feature, not security.

[5]s-nail does have a privsep helper program for creating lock files
   safely as an arbitrary user.  by "privsep" in this file we mean
   more that techniques like sandboxing are used when e.g. parsing email,
   talking to the network, etc, but the s-nail privsep dotlock is also
   valid and deals with a real-world issue.

[6]trojita's tests require a live X server connection and this is
   difficult for me at the moment, since i've been working on this
   remotely for the most part, due to my crappy network connection.
