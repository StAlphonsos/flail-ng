A couple things:
1. Do we need ONLY_FOR_ARCH=${GCC4_ARCHS} if qt5 is in MODULES? Doesn't 
qt5 already imply that?
2. Your patch looks like it has extra fuzz. Run 'make update-patches' again.
3. I'm not going to be a super hard-ass about it, but I'd really like to 
see a second diff after this update goes in that cleans up the port 
Makefile. We don't really need two lines of comments to say 
"Dependencies" (and besides, people looking at this ought to know that 
MODULES and RDEPs are dependencies).

With that said, the update works here so ok for me after point 2 and 
possibly point 1 are addressed.
