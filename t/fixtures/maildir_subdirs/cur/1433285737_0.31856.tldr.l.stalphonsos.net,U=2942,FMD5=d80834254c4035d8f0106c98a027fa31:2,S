I didn't do a lot of testing. I wrote to the list, because I thought I'm
missing something obvious. I will test some more the next days with my
small program on my amd64 systems but my pandaboard got broken a few
month ago and I don't have any other hardware to test.
I also plan to make a rebuild of my desktop system (base and ports) with
an up to date -CURRENT tree and will report if something brakes.
