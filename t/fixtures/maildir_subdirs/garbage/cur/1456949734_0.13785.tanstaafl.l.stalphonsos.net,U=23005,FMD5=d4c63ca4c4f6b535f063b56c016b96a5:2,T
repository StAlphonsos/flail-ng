Dear Friend,

I am Labib Mamduh, Bank Manager I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you,On June 6th 2009 there was an oil consultant/contractor with the Dubai Oilfield Inspection Services,He made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited, valued at fifteen million us dollars ($15million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Dubai Oilfield Inspection Services National Oil Company that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that my late client did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.

This sum of US$15million is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Banking Law, at the expiration of 5 {five} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Dubai Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to my late client so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

This is simple;

(1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. (2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your name for the transfer. (3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin of my late client.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, please reply immediately:I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country

Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards,
Mr.Labib Mamduh,
