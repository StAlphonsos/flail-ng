These are the notes from last week's meeting.

Zeyd: can you do next Thursday 1/26 10 AM for the next one?  Same place.

Caroline is getting an OpenOPS domain, which allows us to start the
infrastructure buildout, including email.

Caroline is also working on the equity agreements.  Yes, she has a lot
on her plate :)

Comments/questions/changes from below appreciated...

Topics of Discussion:

=C2=B7      What we are (reporting entity, with other potential direction=
s)

=E2=80=9CWe collect data on the companies that collect data about users.=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=93
Caroline=E2=80=99s tag line.



=C2=B7      Our audience of =E2=80=9Cusers=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 privacy pro=
fessionals, sales team. Can see
a scenario where a sales team associate sends a pdf of our report on thei=
r
own company to a potential customer as an attempt to show their security
practices. It helps because then the sales team doesn=E2=80=99t have to w=
ait for
the big security questionnaire to come in and then work with engineers at=

their company to fill it out.

=C2=B7      Who is our customer and who are we selling to? Chief Privacy
Officer? We sell to the commercial side.

=C2=B7      The general approach:
The general timeline (?) =E2=80=93 IAPP is where we should be selling. Th=
ey have a
big conference in April but that may be too quick to have a few customers=

already using the product. Aim for their big conference in the Fall? Migh=
t
be better because it is their privacy & security conference. The icon we
use is placed on any company we report on or who uses us but it is not a
signal of being certified by us. On the contrary, we report on companies
security practices. If they are missing an SSL cert, for example, we repo=
rt
on that, but we aren=E2=80=99t drawing any conclusions that this means th=
ey are not
secure.

=C2=B7      Name =E2=80=93 what terms get us to a name:

o   {privacy,policy}hound  # i mean either of those: privacyhound,
policyhound
{privacy,policy}sniff
{privacy,policy}stance
{privacy,policy}canary
{privacy,policy}monitor
{privacy,policy}vision
{privacy,policy}view

o   metacanary
privacypol
privpro
privopticon             # perhaps a bit dystopian
duedilligencer
whodoyoutrust
trustonomicon
trustorbust

o   PMR... privacy meta-report

o   OpenOPS

o   Data Reporting in Privacy and Security:  DRIPS (added post meeting)

o   Disclose (added post meeting)

=C2=B7      Z's contribution

Make us market ready. Putting together something that tells who we are, w=
ho
we want to talk to and helping us take it to the market.



Send George a security questionnaire



George mentions the whitepaper we need to start working on =E2=80=9CPriva=
cy
Practice Assessments in Open Source Data=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 would give us=
 a lot of
intellectual credibility


OpenOPS =3D name for now. We will name it this for now, recognizing that =
it
may not be given as much credibility in the security community because of=

its ties to opensource. The thought behind it was actually opensource
because we are using public data (rather than public source code) to repo=
rt
on our customers/ businesses in general.
